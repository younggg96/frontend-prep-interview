// 2807. Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List
// Given the head of a linked list head, in which each node contains an integer value.

// Between every pair of adjacent nodes, insert a new node with a value equal to the greatest common divisor of them.

// Return the linked list after insertion.

// The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: head = [18,6,10,3]
// Output: [18,6,6,2,10,1,3]
// Explanation: The 1st diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2nd diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes (nodes in blue are the inserted nodes).
// - We insert the greatest common divisor of 18 and 6 = 6 between the 1st and the 2nd nodes.
// - We insert the greatest common divisor of 6 and 10 = 2 between the 2nd and the 3rd nodes.
// - We insert the greatest common divisor of 10 and 3 = 1 between the 3rd and the 4th nodes.
// There are no more adjacent nodes, so we return the linked list.
// Example 2:


// Input: head = [7]
// Output: [7]
// Explanation: The 1st diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2nd diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes.
// There are no pairs of adjacent nodes, so we return the initial linked list.
