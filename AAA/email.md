Subject: Application for Frontend Engineer Role

Hi,

I’m writing to express my interest in the Frontend Engineer position. With 5 years of experience in frontend development and a Master’s degree in Computer Science, I’ve built and maintained a variety of high-impact applications across e-commerce, healthcare, and real estate domains.

Most recently at Vibrant Wellness, I led the migration of a legacy Vue 2 project to Next.js and React, achieving a 35% improvement in load times and a 25% boost in user engagement. I also mentored junior developers and helped establish a scalable UI library using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. Prior to that, I developed mobile and web applications at Alexander-Anderson Real Estate Group and Easy Hundred Inc., building robust, user-friendly platforms using React Native, Expo, and WordPress.

I’m passionate about crafting clean, responsive UIs and delivering seamless user experiences using modern technologies such as React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and NestJS. I enjoy working in fast-paced, agile environments and collaborating closely with designers and backend engineers.

Here is my resume, GitHub, and portfolio for your review:
