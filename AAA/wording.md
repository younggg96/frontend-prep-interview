Dear,

I am excited to apply for the Frontend position. As a seasoned software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and years of experience building dynamic, user-friendly applications, I am eager to bring my skills in modern web development to your innovative team.

During my time as a Senior Software Engineer at Vibrant Wellness, I led efforts to revitalize a legacy Vue 2 project by transitioning it to Next.js and React. This transformation improved load times by 35% and boosted user engagement by 25%. Beyond technical execution, I mentored junior developers, accelerating their adaptation to new technologies and fostering a collaborative environment. These experiences sharpened my ability to balance technical excellence with leadership responsibilities.

In previous roles, I have:

Developed scalable e-commerce and mobile applications from the ground up, such as wellproz.com and CFREE Real Estate Exam Prep, leveraging frameworks like React Native and Vue.js.
Improved UI consistency and user experience by creating reusable component libraries and implementing tailored designs in alignment with branding standards.
Streamlined complex web architectures with Micro-Frontends, cutting code redundancy by 10%.
My technical toolkit spans HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/TypeScript, and modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and Angular. I also bring expertise in backend systems using Node.js and Prisma ORM, ensuring a seamless full-stack development process. Additionally, my proficiency in agile methodologies ensures timely and high-quality deliverables.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be thrilled to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the goals of your team. I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview and can be reached via email at yangguanggeng960123@gmail.com or by phone at 1-551-208-2669.

Sincerely,
Guanggeng Yang
