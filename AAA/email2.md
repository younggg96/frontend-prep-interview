**Subject:** Frontend Engineer – Let's Build Something Awesome Together!

Hi,

I came across your team and was immediately excited about the Frontend Engineer opportunity. I’m Guanggeng, a frontend developer with 3+ years of hands-on experience building web and mobile apps that are fast, clean, and actually fun to use.

Most recently, I rebuilt a legacy Vue 2 project into a modern Next.js + React setup at Vibrant Wellness, improving load times by 35% and boosting engagement by 25%. I also helped shape a scalable UI library with Tailwind and shadcn/ui, and mentored junior teammates along the way. Before that, I worked on mobile apps and e-commerce platforms at Alexander-Anderson and Easy Hundred.

I’m super comfortable in fast-moving environments, love collaborating with designers and backend folks, and take pride in writing code that’s both readable and efficient.

Here’s my resume, GitHub, and portfolio—would love to connect and see if we’re a good fit!

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Cheers,
