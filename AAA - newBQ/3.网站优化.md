## You mentioned strong performance improvements. What specific optimizations did you implement, and how did you measure their impact?

I usually look at performance from three dimensions: network, rendering, and user experience.

On the network side, we reduced the JavaScript bundle by removing unused libraries, splitting routes, and optimizing images with Next’s built-in Image component. This helped cut down the amount of data users download on first load.

On the rendering side, we adopted SSR and SSG for high-traffic pages so meaningful content appears immediately. We also deferred non-critical scripts and used dynamic imports to ensure heavy components—like charts or editors—load only when the user actually needs them.

From a user-experience perspective, we focused not only on raw speed but also on how fast the product feels. We added skeleton screens, smooth transitions, and lightweight animations to guide the user’s attention and make interactions feel more responsive. These micro-interactions helped reduce perceived waiting time, especially in flows like checkout and product detail loading.

Together, these optimizations significantly improved both lab metrics and real user experience. 

For example, our LCP dropped from 3.1 seconds to 1.2 seconds, fully-loaded time went from 8.4 seconds to 1.3 seconds, and we saw meaningful improvements in engagement and conversions.
