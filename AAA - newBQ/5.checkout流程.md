## Can you walk me through the design of your multi-step checkout flow and how you ensured it was robust?

Our previous checkout was a long, single page and had a relatively high drop-off rate. I redesigned it as a guided multi-step flow: address → product selection → patient info → payment.

From a technical side, I used React Context plus SessionStorage so that if a user refreshes or navigates away and back, their progress and data are preserved. For payments, we integrated both Stripe and PayPal, and I worked closely with our backend team to keep the flow PCI-compliant.

In terms of robustness, we built:

Clear validation and error messages at each step.

Idempotent payment requests so users wouldn’t be double-charged if they retried.

E2E tests in Playwright that simulate the full checkout scenario, including edge cases like network failures.

After launch, we monitored drop-off at each step using Mixpanel and adjusted copy and UI where we saw confusion. This combination of technical guardrails and data-driven iteration helped make the flow much more reliable and user-friendly.
