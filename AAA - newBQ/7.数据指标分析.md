## You mentioned strong performance improvements. What specific optimizations did you implement, and how did you measure their impact?

英文回答（STAR 结构）：

One example is how we used analytics to improve our onboarding and product pages.

Situation / Task: We saw that a lot of users were landing on certain product pages, but conversion was lower than expected.

Action: I instrumented detailed events in Mixpanel and GA4, tracking scroll depth, clicks on FAQs, and time spent above the fold. We discovered that many users dropped off before reaching important information like shop benefits, product info and shipping details.

Based on that, I worked with design to move key benefits higher on the page, added a sticky “Add to cart” bar, and simplified some copy. We also A/B tested different layouts.

Result: After these changes, conversion on those pages improved by roughly 20–25%, and bounce rate dropped by around 15%.


中文要点：

场景：某些产品页流量不错，但转化偏低。

我在 Mixpanel 和 GA4 做了更细的埋点（滚动深度、FAQ 点击、首屏停留时间），发现很多用户在看到关键信息之前就离开了。

根据数据，我和设计一起把关键信息（产品利益点、物流说明）上移，增加粘性“加入购物车”条，并对不同布局做 A/B 测试。

结果：这些页面的转化提升了大约 20–25%，跳出率下降约 15%。
