## Tell me about the UI component library you built. What problems did it solve and how did you roll it out to the team?
英文回答：

Before the library, every feature team was building slightly different versions of dialogs, forms, and dropdowns. It slowed us down and made accessibility hard to guarantee.

I built a component library on top of Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and Radix. My goals were:

Standardize patterns for forms, dialogs, and navigation.

Encapsulate accessibility best practices, like focus management and keyboard navigation.

Make it easy to theme components for different tenants.

I started by auditing the existing UI, grouping similar patterns, and then designing a small set of primitives—Button, Input, Dialog, Select, etc. Then I documented usage, props, and examples in Storybook-style docs.

To roll it out, I picked a real feature as a pilot, migrated it to the new components, and collected feedback from other engineers and designers. After that, we set a guideline that all new features use the library first, and we gradually refactored legacy screens when we touched them for other changes.

中文要点：

在做组件库之前，每个功能团队都自己写 Dialog、Form、Dropdown，代码重复很多，也不利于统一无障碍标准。

我基于 Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Radix 做了一套组件库，目标是：

统一表单、对话框、导航等模式；

内置 ARIA、键盘导航、focus 管理等可访问性能力；

支持多租户的主题切换。

落地方式：

先梳理全站 UI，抽象一批基础组件；

做好文档和示例；

选一个真实需求做试点，迁移并收集反馈；

规定新功能优先用组件库，老页面则在需求变更时逐步替换。
