# Walk me through your current role at Vibrant Wellness

English — optimized for interviews

My name is Guanggeng Yang, and I’m currently a Senior Frontend Engineer and frontend tech lead at Vibrant Wellness, which is a medical e-commerce platform helping patients purchase products through their doctor’s shop.

I’ve been here for more than four years, and I’ve led the design and development of almost the entire frontend architecture. When I joined, the frontend system was a legacy Vue 2 with slow performance, poor SEO, and a lot of duplicated UI patterns.

My main mission has been modernizing and scaling our storefront. I led the end-to-end migration from Vue 2 to a Next.js + React architecture using hybrid SSR and CSR. After the migration, our GTmetrix grade, LCP and fully loaded time went down, it improve the website performance a lot.

On the product side, I implemented all core e-commerce features — product pages, shopping cart, checkout flow, payment flow, order tracking system, and more. I also built our internal component library using Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and Radix to standardize dialogs, forms, and navigation across multiple teams.

I also designed a subdomain-driven setup where each partner shop can customize its theme and settings, ui component, but the entire platform is maintained through one unified codebase.

Day to day, I focus on writing production-quality code, reviewing PRs, and making architectural decisions to keep the codebase maintainable and scalable as the business grows. I also collaborate closely with product, design, and backend engineers to ensure we deliver consistent and high-quality user experiences.

Overall, I’m experienced with JavaScript, React, Next.js, Vue, and if you’d like to dive deeper into any specific part, I’m happy to discuss it.
