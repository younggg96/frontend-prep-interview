What attracted you to this role/company?

I’m really excited about this role because it fits my background in frontend architecture, performance optimization, and building UI design systems. I’ve led projects focused on performance, scalability, and clean user experience, and this role at Netflix feels like a great opportunity to continue growing in those areas.

What also really stood out to me is the culture. I read the Netflix Culture Memo, and I really connected with how much the company values things like selflessness, candor, creativity, and courage. I do my best work in environments where people trust each other, give open feedback, take on challenges, stay curious—and from everything I’ve learned, that’s exactly how teams work at Netflix.

That why i am interested in this role



What do you know about our company or product?

Yeah! I know Netflix is one of the leading entertainment platforms globally, with a huge user base across web, mobile, and TV.

From a frontend perspective, I really admire how you’ve built such a fast and scalable experience across devices, and how you invest in design systems and internal tools to support developer productivity.
