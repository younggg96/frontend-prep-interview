What attracted you to this role/company?

I’m really excited about this role because it fits my background in frontend architecture and performance work. I’ve been leading projects that focus on speed, scalability, and clean design, and your company seems like a place where I can keep growing with the teams on different products. I also like that you value collaboration—working with a strong team is important to me.

What do you know about our company or product?

Yeah! I know that OKX is one of the top global crypto exchanges, and you're also doing a lot in the Web3 space—like DeFi, NFTs, and wallets.
I really admire how you're building a fast, scalable platform for millions of users. As someone who cares about performance and frontend architecture, I find that super exciting.
