（可以介绍一个你最近做过的项目吗？）

Sure! One of the projects I worked was at Vibrant Wellness. I led the frontend rearchitecture of e-commerce platform from 0 to production. The old system was built with Vue 2 and had issues like slow web loading, poor SEO, and inconsistent UI.

I redesigned the architecture using React, Next.js, and implemented SSR and SSG for better performance and SEO. 

I also built internal UI component system. We started with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui as a base, and from there I created a set of modular, reusable components—things like buttons, form elements and interactive components like drawers and tabs. I documented each component clearly and set up Storybook so other developers could preview, test, and plug them into their workflows. The goal was to ensure consistency in visual style and behavior across the platform.

I worked closely with designers to translate mockups into scalable components, and also worked with backend team to define APIs in a way that fit frontend needs and performance constraints.
We used tools like Figma, Jira, and Confluence to stay aligned across teams and avoid miscommunication.

As the frontend tech lead, I handled everything from architecture planning to mentoring junior devs. I’m proud because I took ownership from zero to launch and made a measurable business impact.



Can you describe a project you're proud of?

one of my proudest project is the web application I designed and developed at VW. I am the tech lead on this project and led a team of 3 to design and developed the current UI web application and brought it to production. in this project, I designed and worked on most of the major features such as the xxx pages and xxx pagesx... I still can remeber the moment that the web app went live and how proud and happy I felt.
