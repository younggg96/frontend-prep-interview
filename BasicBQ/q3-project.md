Can you tell me about a project you worked on recently?
（可以介绍一个你最近做过的项目吗？）
Sure! One of the most impactful projects I worked on was at Vibrant Wellness. I led the frontend rearchitecture of their e-commerce platform from the ground up. The old system was built with Vue 2 and had issues like slow builds, poor SEO, and inconsistent UI.
I redesigned the architecture using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, and implemented SSR and SSG for better performance and SEO. We also introduced component-based development and reusable patterns, which helped improve team efficiency and code quality.
As the frontend tech lead, I handled everything from architecture planning to mentoring junior devs. Within three months of launch, organic traffic went up by 30%. I’m proud because I took ownership from zero to launch and made a measurable business impact.

Can you describe a project you're proud of?

one of my proudest project is the web application I designed and developed at VW. I am the tech lead on this project and led a team of 3 to design and developed the current UI web application and brought it to production. in this project, I designed and worked on most of the major features such as the xxx pages and xxx pagesx... I still can remeber the moment that the web app went live and how proud and happy I felt.
