## Init Call 问题类型与例题：

1. 背景 & 当前状态
Can you briefly walk me through your background?
What are you currently working on?
I'm a frontend developer with around 5 years of experience. I'm currently working at Vibrant Wellness, where I'm responsible for building an e-commerce platform in the medical field. Recently, I've been leading the migration of a large Vue 2 codebase to a modern React and Next.js stack. I focus on building clean, reusable UI components, optimizing performance, and improving SEO. As a team lead, I also enjoy mentoring junior developers through documentation, code reviews, and hands-on support. Now, I'm looking for a new opportunity where I can continue to grow and contribute to impactful projects.

Why are you looking for new opportunities?

I’ve learned a lot in my current role, especially around frontend architecture and team collaboration. But I’m ready for something new—something more technically challenging, where I can move faster, work closely with product teams, and build things that really make an impact. I’m also excited about learning from talented engineers and contributing to larger-scale systems.

Are you actively interviewing elsewhere?

Yes, I’m speaking with a few companies right now, but I’m still exploring and trying to find the best fit—for both the team and the kind of work I want to grow into. I’m genuinely interested in this opportunity, and I’d love to learn more about how your team works.

2. 对公司的兴趣
What attracted you to this role/company?

Yeah, I was really interested in this role because it involves building complex front-end applications, which is something I enjoy and have experience with. I’ve worked a lot with React and Angular, so the tech stack feels like a great fit. Also, the chance to work with a smart, cross-functional team at here sounds exciting. I’m always looking to grow by working on meaningful and technically challenging projects.


How did you hear about us?

I came across the role while browsing job openings related to front-end development, and the description really stood out. I also recognized X as part of Alphabet, and that definitely caught my attention because I’ve always been interested in working on ambitious, impactful tech projects.


What do you know about our company or product?

I know that X is Alphabet’s innovation lab, focused on solving big, global problems. I saw that the Tapestry project is working on improving the electric grid using technology and data, which sounds both meaningful and technically interesting. I’m still learning more, but it seems like a really unique space to work

3. 技术能力（轻量评估）
What’s your strongest programming language or framework?

Do you focus more on frontend, backend, or fullstack?

Have you worked with [React/TypeScript/Next.js/etc.]?

data visualization （Google Maps APIs & D3）
Yes, I’ve worked with several data visualization tools. For example, I used Google Maps APIs to build an order tracking feature where users could see their delivery status and location updates in real time. I’ve also used D3 for custom charts when I needed more control over interactivity and design.

Unit test
Yes, I write unit tests regularly, especially for reusable components and important business logic. In my current and past projects, I’ve used tools like Jest for React and Jasmine + Karma when working with Angular. I try to keep tests isolated, test both typical and edge cases, and mock dependencies as needed. I also focus on writing tests that are meaningful—not just for coverage, but to catch regressions and ensure confidence during refactors.

Have you built products from scratch or worked on large systems?

Yes, I’ve done both. In my current role, I helped rebuild a large e-commerce platform in the medical field—starting from scratch, migrating it from Vue 2 to a modern stack with React and Next.js. I was involved in setting up the architecture, building reusable components, and integrating APIs. I've also worked on large legacy systems where I had to understand existing codebases and gradually refactor or extend them without breaking things.


Yes, I’ve built products from scratch and also worked on large-scale systems. At Alexander Anderson Real Estate, I built a mobile app from the ground up using React Native. The app was designed to help users get their real estate licenses—it included learning modules, progress tracking, and scheduling tools. I handled the full front-end development, including UI design, navigation, and API integration.

In my current role at Vibrant Wellness, I’ve been leading the rebuild of a complex e-commerce platform in the healthcare space, migrating it from Vue 2 to React and Next.js. So I’ve had experience working on both new mobile apps and large enterprise web systems.

4. 项目经验
Can you describe a project you're proud of?

One project I’m really proud of is a mobile app I built at Alexander Anderson Real Estate. The goal was to help users prepare for and get their real estate licenses. I built the entire front end using React Native, including features like learning modules, progress tracking, and scheduling.

It was a solo project on the front-end side, so I got to own everything—from designing the UI to integrating with the backend and making sure it worked smoothly on both iOS and Android. Seeing the app go from concept to something real that people used and gave positive feedback on was really rewarding.

Have you ever worked on a 0 → 1 project?

Have you worked in fast-paced or startup environments?

5. 行为和团队协作
Do you prefer working independently or collaboratively?

I enjoy both, honestly. I’m very comfortable working independently—I’ve led projects where I handled the full front end on my own, like the mobile app I built using React Native. But I also really enjoy working collaboratively, especially in cross-functional teams. On my current project, I work closely with backend engineers, designers, and product managers to make sure everything fits together well. So for me, the ideal setup is a mix of both—focused solo time and good team communication.

How do you handle deadlines or shifting priorities?

Have you ever mentored teammates or led initiatives?

Yes, I’ve mentored junior developers on my team—helping them get up to speed with our tech stack, reviewing their code, and sharing best practices. I also led the frontend migration of a large Vue 2 codebase to React and Next.js, where I set up the architecture, broke down tasks, and worked closely with others to guide the transition. I really enjoy helping teammates grow.

6. 职位匹配 & 未来规划
What are you looking for in your next role?

I’m looking for a role where I can take on more technical ownership and work on meaningful, complex products. I enjoy working with modern front-end technologies, and I’d love to be part of a team that values good engineering practices and collaboration. It’s also important to me that the work has real-world impact, which is why this role really fit me

What does an ideal team or project look like for you?

Are you open to in-office / remote / hybrid work?

What are your compensation expectations?

When would you be available to start?

I’m open to discussing that based on the role’s responsibilities and the overall compensation package. From my research and experience level, I’d expect $180,000 base, but I’m flexible depending on equity, bonus.


### workflow

My workflow’s pretty balanced. I usually start by checking tasks and syncing with the team in stand-up. Then I spend a good chunk of my day coding—probably around 60–70% of the time—working on features, fixing bugs, or doing some refactoring. The rest goes into code reviews, helping teammates, and communicating with product or backend to clarify things. I try to keep my work structured, so I don’t jump between too many tasks at once.


### prioritize your work - impact & urgency
If I have a bunch of tasks, I usually look at what’s most urgent or what’s blocking others, and start there. If priorities aren’t super clear, I’ll check in with the PM to make sure I’m working on the right thing. I try not to juggle too many things at once—breaking down big features helps me stay focused and make progress without feeling overwhelmed
