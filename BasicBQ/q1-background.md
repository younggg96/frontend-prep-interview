# 1. 背景 & 当前状态

**Can you briefly walk me through your background?**
**What are you currently working on?**

Hi, my name is Guanggeng Yang. I'm the lead frontend developer at Vibrant Wellness. I have been here for 4 years. I led the design and development of our entire ecommerce web platform, I implemented E-Commerce Core Features such as the product and product detail page, shopping cart, checkout flow, payment, user authenication, user profile and more. I am also experienced with UI framework migration. I helped VW to migrade its UI framework from Vue 2 to react and next.js that enhence the web prefromance and SEO. As you can see, I am experienced with Javascript, react, nextJS and other UI realated technologies. if you are interested in any specific part of my experiences, we can start from there.

**Why are you looking for new opportunities? why are you looking for new job?**

As I just said, I have been at VW for more than 4 years. I led the design and development of our entire web appilication. At this point in my career at VW, my job duties have become less challenging and more repetitive. I often found myself doing the same thing every day and did not have time to learn new technologies. So it is time for me to look outside opportunities to further my skill sets and career. I heard from Scott, who is also working at OKX, that OKX is looking for a front end developer. He told me about the fast pacing environment at OKX. I think it would be a perfect opportunity for me to challenge myself and learn more cutting edge technologies


**I noticed you were working at two companies at the same time—can you explain that?**

Yes, I’m glad you asked. During that period, I was transitioning into a full-time role at Vibrant Wellness while continuing to support Alexander-Anderson in a part-time remote capacity.
At Vibrant, I was responsible for leading the frontend development of a new e-commerce platform. Meanwhile, I continued maintaining and shipping updates for the mobile app I had previously built for Alexander-Anderson.
I treated both roles seriously, set clear boundaries for time and priorities, and ensured that all deliverables were met with quality.
This experience really strengthened my ability to manage multiple responsibilities, communicate across teams.
