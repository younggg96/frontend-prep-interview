# 1. 背景 & 当前状态

**Can you briefly walk me through your background?**
**What are you currently working on?**

My name is Guanggeng Yang and I’m now working at VW as a Senior frontend developer.

So our team is frontend dev team. We are responsible for our e-Commerce platform in medical field.

I have been here for 4 yrs. I led the design and development of our entire frontend.

I implemented E-commerce core features such as product page, shopping cart, checkout flow, payment, order tracking system and more.

I also experienced with UI framework migration. I helped it migrate from Vue 2 to NextJS and ReactJS to improve performance and SEO.

Previously I worked at AA as a frontend developer too. I built a mobile app by React Native, helped users to learn and pursue their real estate license.

I designed & implemented all features by myself, such as learning module, push notification, subscription.

As you can see, I am experienced with Javascript, react, nextJS, react native, vue and other UI realated technologies. if you are interested in any specific part of my experiences, we can start from there.

**Why are you looking for new opportunities? why are you looking for new job?**

As I just said, I have been at Vibrant Wellness for 4+ years. I led the design and development of our entire web application. At this point in my career at VW, my job duties have become less challenging and more repetitive.
I often found myself doing the same thing every day and didn’t have time to learn new technologies.
So it’s time for me to look outside opportunities to further my skills and career.

I have always admired Netflix not just for the scale of platform but for its culture.
I just read the culture memo and I really appreciate how much the company values Selflessness, creativity, open feedback, high-performance.

I like that kind of environment because I like working with people who care about what they do and push each other to do great work.
So I think it would be an amazing place to keep growing, take on new challenges, and work with talented people.


**I noticed you were working at two companies at the same time—can you explain that?**

Yes, I’m glad you asked. During that period, I was transitioning into a full-time role at Vibrant Wellness while continuing to support Alexander-Anderson as a part-time remote role.
At Vibrant, I was responsible for building the frontend of the e-commerce platform. Meanwhile, I continued maintaining and shipping updates for the mobile app I had previously built for Alexander-Anderson.
I treated both roles seriously, set clear boundaries for time and priorities, and make sure that all deliverables were met with quality.
This experience really improve my ability to manage multiple responsibilities, communicate across teams.
