5. 行为和团队协作
Can you describe your working style in a team?
I’m a collaborative and transparent team player. I like to align early on goals and scope, and I make sure to communicate clearly during standups and code reviews. I enjoy pair programming when needed, and I often help break down tasks so the team can move faster. I also value feedback—both giving and receiving—because it helps us improve together.


Do you prefer working independently or collaboratively?
honestly, I enjoy both. I’m very comfortable working independently—I have led projects where I handled the full front end on my own, like the mobile app I built using React Native at Alexander-Anderson. At Alexander Anderson, I was the only developer there. for whatever project I work on, I need to do everything and by myself. I deisgned, developed and maintained the mobile app. I also worked on the deployment of the mobile app. basically i was not just a front end developer but more a full stack. But i enjoy front end developing more. so at vw, I become the tech lead here. I work closely with 3 other devlopers. I also work in cross-functional teams. I work closely with backend engineers, designers, and product managers to make sure everything fits together well. So for me, the good setup is a mix of both—focused solo time and good team communication.

Have you ever mentored junior engineers? How did you help them?
你有指导新人吗？具体怎么帮助的？

Yes, I have mentored junior engineer. I usually start by helping them understand the architecture and project context. Then I guide them through writing clean, modular code and thinking through edge cases. I also do regular 1-on-1s to check in on progress and challenges. Over time, I try to help them grow not just technically, but also in terms of confidence and ownership.
