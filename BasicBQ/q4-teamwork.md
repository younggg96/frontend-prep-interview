5. 行为和团队协作
**Can you describe your working style in a team?**
I’m a collaborative and transparent team player. I like to align early on goals and scope, and I make sure to communicate clearly during standups and code reviews. I enjoy pair programming when needed, and I often help break down tasks so the team can move faster. I also value feedback—both giving and receiving—because it helps us improve together.


**Do you prefer working independently or collaboratively?**
honestly, I enjoy both. I’m very comfortable working independently—I have led projects where I handled the full front end on my own, like the mobile app I built using React Native at Alexander-Anderson. At Alexander Anderson, I was the only developer there. for whatever project I work on, I need to do everything and by myself. I deisgned, developed and maintained the mobile app. I also worked on the deployment of the mobile app. basically i was not just a front end developer but more a full stack. But i enjoy front end developing more. so at vw, I become the tech lead here. I work closely with 3 other devlopers. I also work in cross-functional teams. I work closely with backend engineers, designers, and product managers to make sure everything fits together well. So for me, the good setup is a mix of both—focused solo time and good team communication.

**Have you ever mentored junior engineers? How did you help them?**
你有指导新人吗？具体怎么帮助的？

Yes, I have mentored junior engineer. I usually start by helping them understand the architecture and project context. Then I guide them through writing clean, modular code and thinking through edge cases. I also do regular 1-on-1s to check in on progress and challenges. Over time, I try to help them grow not just technically, but also in terms of confidence and ownership.


**Tell me about a time when you balanced multiple responsibilities effectively.**
多任务

I was transitioning into a full-time role at Vibrant Wellness while still supporting Alexander-Anderson as a part-time remote developer.

At Vibrant wellness, I was responsible for building the frontend e-commerce platform. Meanwhile, I needed to continue maintaining and updating the React Native mobile app I had previously built for Alexander-Anderson along with wrapping up a few remaining tasks and handling the handoff process.

To manage both roles effectively, I set clear time boundaries and maintained open communication with both teams. I prioritized weekly goals based on impact and urgency, and committed to deliver high-quality work while ensuring all deliverables were met on time and with quality.

Both projects stayed on track. We kept making solid progress on the Vibrant Wellness platform, and the Alexander-Anderson app continued to receive regular updates. After finishing the remaining tasks and handoff work at Alexander-Anderson, I was able to fully focus on the development at Vibrant Wellness. 

This experience really strengthened my ability to manage multiple responsibilities, communication between different teams，working independently.
