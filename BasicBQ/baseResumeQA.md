太好了！以下是根据你的简历为你定制的英文高质量面试问答（附中文翻译）。我先准备前两个主题（前端架构与性能优化、测试与质量保障），如果你觉得满意，我们可以继续下面的内容。

一、Frontend Architecture & Performance Optimization

Q1: What were the main technical challenges you faced when migrating from Vue 2 to Next.js/React? How did you overcome them?

Answer (EN):
One major challenge was rethinking component structure and state management to align with React’s unidirectional data flow and hooks-based paradigm. I had to refactor legacy Vue code that heavily relied on two-way binding and global mixins into modular React components using useState, useEffect, and custom hooks. Another challenge was rebuilding routing and SSR behavior. I leveraged Next.js’s file-based routing and server-side rendering (SSR) features, optimizing hydration and load performance. I also ensured SEO consistency by preserving semantic markup and meta configurations during the transition.

中文翻译：
一个主要挑战是需要重新设计组件结构和状态管理方式，使其符合 React 的单向数据流和基于 hooks 的模式。我将大量依赖双向绑定和全局 mixin 的 Vue 旧代码重构为使用 useState、useEffect 和自定义 hook 的模块化 React 组件。另一个挑战是重建路由和 SSR 行为。我利用了 Next.js 的文件式路由和服务器端渲染功能，优化了 hydration 和加载性能。同时在迁移过程中也保留了语义化标签和 meta 配置，确保了 SEO 一致性。

Q2: Can you explain how you applied SSR and SSG in your project, and why you used both?

Answer (EN):
We used SSR for dynamic pages like product detail, search, and checkout where real-time content and SEO were critical. This allowed us to pre-render on the server, reducing time-to-interactive and improving Lighthouse SEO scores. For content that changes less frequently, such as static product collections or informational pages, we used SSG to cache and serve content faster via CDN. This hybrid approach balanced performance, SEO, and scalability.

中文翻译：
我们将 SSR 应用于产品详情页、搜索页、结账页等对实时内容和 SEO 要求较高的页面。这样可以在服务器预渲染页面，降低首次交互时间，同时提升 Lighthouse 的 SEO 分数。而对于变更不频繁的内容，例如静态产品分类或信息页面，我们采用了 SSG，通过 CDN 缓存内容以加快加载速度。这种混合策略很好地平衡了性能、SEO 和可扩展性。

Q3: You mentioned improving GTmetrix scores significantly. What exact optimizations did you implement to achieve that?

Answer (EN):
We implemented route-based code splitting using dynamic import() to reduce initial JS bundle size. Images were optimized using next/image for lazy loading and automatic resizing. Fonts were loaded with font-display: swap, and unused CSS was purged using Tailwind’s JIT mode. We also minimized third-party scripts and replaced some legacy plugins with lightweight alternatives. As a result, LCP dropped from 3.1s to 1.2s, and page size was reduced by 85%.

中文翻译：
我们使用动态 import() 实现了基于路由的代码拆分，减少了初始 JS 包体积。图片使用 next/image 实现懒加载和自动尺寸调整。字体设置了 font-display: swap，同时通过 Tailwind 的 JIT 模式去除未使用的 CSS。我们还精简了第三方脚本，替换了一些老旧的插件为更轻量的版本。最终 LCP 从 3.1 秒降到了 1.2 秒，页面体积减少了 85%。

二、Testing & Quality Assurance

Q4: How did you structure your frontend tests with Jest and Playwright? What parts of the system were covered?

Answer (EN):
For Jest, we focused on unit testing reusable components and business logic like the shopping cart, filtering, and price calculations. We organized tests into modular directories with mocks and coverage reports. Playwright was used for end-to-end flows such as login, checkout, and search. We integrated tests into our CI pipeline to run on every pull request. This layered approach allowed us to validate both isolated logic and complete user journeys.

中文翻译：
在 Jest 部分，我们专注于对可复用组件和业务逻辑（如购物车、筛选、价格计算）进行单元测试，测试结构模块化管理，并生成覆盖率报告。Playwright 用于测试登录、结账、搜索等端到端流程。所有测试都集成到 CI 流水线中，在每次 PR 时运行。这种分层测试策略确保了既能验证底层逻辑，也能保证完整用户流程的正确性。

Q5: How did you ensure high test coverage (85%+)? What tools or strategies did you use?

Answer (EN):
We used Istanbul with Jest to monitor coverage in real time and enforced coverage thresholds during CI builds. To reach 85%+, I prioritized critical user journeys and business logic, applying TDD in complex modules. I also encouraged the team to adopt a “test-as-you-build” mindset and performed regular test audits to catch regressions. Additionally, end-to-end Playwright scripts filled in gaps not covered by unit tests.

中文翻译：
我们通过 Jest 集成 Istanbul 来实时监控测试覆盖率，并在 CI 中设置覆盖率门槛以强制执行。在推动覆盖率超过 85% 的过程中，我优先测试关键业务流程和复杂逻辑模块，并对部分模块采用了 TDD。同时，我鼓励团队“边写边测”，并定期进行测试审查，及时发现回归问题。此外，Playwright 的端到端测试也有效补充了单元测试无法覆盖的部分。
