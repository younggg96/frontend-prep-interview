I once set a goal to create an entire set of complex UI animations from scratch for a project, without relying on any animation libraries. My aim was to achieve smooth transitions, responsive interactions, and intricate micro-animations by writing the code myself, giving me a deeper understanding of animation principles.

However, as I started working on it, I found that the time and effort required were far beyond what I had anticipated. To balance project timelines and maintain quality, I eventually decided on a middle ground: incorporating a lightweight animation library to handle the core animations while focusing on custom interactions for micro-details. This experience taught me the value of using tools efficiently and being realistic when setting ambitious goals.

我曾设定过一个目标，想在一个项目中从零开始实现一整套复杂的UI动画效果，而不依赖任何动画库。我的初衷是希望通过纯手写代码来实现流畅的动画过渡、交互响应和细致的微交互，从而深入理解动画的核心原理。

然而在实际操作中我发现，这项任务所需的时间和精力远超预期。为了兼顾项目进度和整体效果，最终我选择了折中方案，引入了一些轻量级的动画库来辅助实现核心动画部分，同时在微交互细节上尽量保持自定义。这次经历让我认识到，合理利用工具能提高效率，而设定目标时也需要考虑实际情况。
