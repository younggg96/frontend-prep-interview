有一次，我们团队在开发自有的 UI 组件库时，遇到了一些意想不到的挑战。项目的初衷是基于设计图构建一套完整的可复用组件库，以便在未来的项目中提升开发效率。在最初的时间评估中，我认为能够在预定的时间内完成，但在实际开发过程中，我低估了每个组件的复杂性和组件数量的庞大程度。

一方面，每个组件不仅要实现设计图中的外观，还需要考虑到各种状态的变化（如 hover、active、disabled 等），以及与不同浏览器和屏幕尺寸的兼容性。这些细节的处理耗费了比预想更多的时间。另一方面，设计图中的组件种类繁多，从简单的按钮、输入框到复杂的下拉菜单和多选框，每个组件的实现都需要不同的逻辑和样式支持。随着开发深入，原计划的时间安排显得越来越紧张。

当我意识到项目进度会受到影响时，我立刻与团队和项目经理沟通，详细说明了当前的状况和组件复杂性带来的延迟。我提出了一种解决方案，即将组件开发分为多个阶段，优先完成常用的核心组件（如按钮、输入框等），确保能够尽快上线基础功能。同时，针对一些较为复杂的组件，安排在后续迭代中逐步实现，以保证整体项目的进度。

最终，我们按照分阶段的策略完成了组件库的开发。通过这次经历，我深刻认识到在构建组件库时，应该更加充分地评估复杂性和工作量，也学会了在项目进展中灵活调整计划，以确保优先级高的任务按时交付。

There was a time when our team faced unexpected challenges while developing our own UI component library. The goal was to build a reusable component library based on design mockups. Initially, I estimated that we could complete it within the planned timeline, but as we progressed, I realized I had underestimated the complexity of each component.

On one hand, each component not only had to match the design mockups visually but also required handling various states (such as hover, active, and disabled) and ensuring it can adapt across different browsers and screen sizes. These details took much more time. Additiona, the design included a wide range of components, from simple buttons and input fields to complex dropdown menus and multi-selects, each requiring unique logic and styling. As we moved forward, the original timeline became increasingly tight.

I notice this would affect our project schedule, I immediately discussed the situation with the team and project manager, explaining the added complexity and resulting delays. I suggest that we split development to several stages, prioritizing the core components (such as buttons and input fields) to ensure that we could launch the basic functionality on time. For more complex components, we planned to complete them in later on generation, allowing the overall project to stay on track.

In the end, we successfully delivered the component library following this approach. This experience taught me the importance of estimating complexity and workload when building a component library, as well as the value of flexible planning to ensure high-priority tasks are delivered on time.
