1. I'm a frontend developer with around 5 years of experience. I'm currently working at Vibrant Wellness, where I'm responsible for building an e-commerce platform in the medical field. Recently, I've been leading the migration of a large Vue 2 codebase to a modern React and Next.js stack. I focus on building clean, reusable UI components, optimizing performance, and improving SEO. As a team lead, I also enjoy mentoring junior developers through documentation, code reviews, and hands-on support. Now, I'm looking for a new opportunity where I can continue to grow and contribute to impactful projects.

2. Why are you looking for a new opportunity?
Answer:
I’ve learned a lot in my current role, especially around frontend architecture and team collaboration. But I’m ready for something new—something more technically challenging, where I can move faster, work closely with product teams, and build things that really make an impact. I’m also excited about learning from strong engineers and contributing to larger-scale systems.

3. Tell me about a time when you had to work under a tight deadline.
Answer:
Situation: We had a marketing campaign launching in 3 days, but the landing page wasn’t complete.
Task: I was responsible for implementing the responsive layout and SEO optimizations.
Action: I worked with the designer to clarify visuals, used pre-built components to speed up development, and implemented Lighthouse checks early.
Result: We delivered on time, and the campaign achieved a 30% higher conversion rate than previous ones.

4. Describe a time when you had a conflict with a teammate.
Answer:
Situation: A teammate and I disagreed over the implementation of a global state solution.
Task: We needed to choose between Redux and Zustand within a short time.
Action: I proposed a tech review session where we compared pros/cons and ran a quick POC for both.
Result: We aligned on Zustand, reduced boilerplate by 40%, and the discussion improved team trust.

5. Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake.
Answer:
Situation: I once built a filter component based on hardcoded category values, misunderstanding the requirement.
Task: It was meant to be dynamic and server-driven.
Action: I quickly refactored the component to fetch options via API and added fallback behavior.
Result: The fix was deployed within the same sprint. It taught me to ask clarifying questions early and review requirements in more detail.

6. How do you prioritize tasks when you have multiple deadlines?
Answer:
I usually start by listing all tasks, clarifying deadlines and impact. I use a priority matrix to separate urgent vs important items. For time-sensitive tasks, I communicate early with stakeholders if trade-offs are needed. I also break work into smaller deliverables and track progress using Jira or Notion to stay organized and transparent.

7. Tell me about a time you received critical feedback. How did you react?
Answer:
Situation: In a code review, a senior engineer pointed out that my PR lacked unit tests and had inconsistent naming.
Action: I thanked them, revised the PR with better test coverage and naming conventions, and added a pre-commit linter to avoid similar issues.
Result: My future PRs were cleaner and got approved faster. It helped me level up my code quality and professionalism.

8. How do you stay up to date with industry trends or new technologies?
Answer:
I follow blogs like CSS-Tricks, Smashing Magazine, and the official React and Next.js blogs. I also subscribe to newsletters like Frontend Focus and watch conference talks on YouTube. For hands-on practice, I regularly build side projects and test new tools like AI integrations, new frameworks, or design systems.

9. Tell me about a time you took initiative.
Answer:
Situation: Our product detail page had performance issues, but no one was assigned to optimize it.
Action: I investigated using Chrome DevTools, lazy-loaded images, split bundles with dynamic imports, and optimized critical rendering paths.
Result: Page load time dropped by 40%, and bounce rates decreased. My work became a reference for optimizing other pages.

10. What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Answer:
Strengths: I’m proactive, highly organized, and passionate about writing maintainable code. I often take initiative on improvements even when not assigned.
Weaknesses: I used to be overly perfectionist, spending too much time fine-tuning non-critical parts. I’ve learned to focus more on impact and align with business priorities.
