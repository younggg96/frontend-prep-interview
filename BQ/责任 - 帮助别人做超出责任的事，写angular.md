There was a time when our team was working on an Angular project that required complex form validation and dynamic field display logic. My main responsibilities were centered around React and Next.js work, so Angular wasn't my area of expertise. However, some team members were struggling with implementing these features, which was causing delays.

Even though Angular wasn’t part of my core responsibilities, I decided to step in and help. I quickly familiarized myself with Angular's reactive form modules and worked with the team to break down the implementation logic. I helped write the code for dynamic form validations, allowing fields to show or hide based on user input, and ensured that all validation rules were correctly applied. Throughout the process, I also shared some of my componentization insights from React projects, offering reusable design ideas that could benefit the team in the long run.

This experience taught me the value of stepping in to offer cross-functional support, as it helped move the project forward and introduced the team to new development perspectives. Ultimately, we completed the project on schedule, and the team’s technical skill set expanded as a result.

有一次，我们的团队在一个 Angular 项目中需要实现复杂的表单验证和动态字段显示逻辑。当时我主要负责 React 和 Next.js 相关的工作，Angular 并不是我的专长，但项目的其他成员在处理这部分功能时遇到了一些困难，导致进度受阻。

尽管 Angular 不在我的主要职责范围内，我还是决定提供帮助。我快速学习了相关的 Angular 表单模块，并与团队成员一起分析了实现逻辑。我帮助编写了动态表单验证的代码，使字段能够根据用户输入自动显示或隐藏，并确保了验证规则的准确性。在这个过程中，我还分享了一些在 React 项目中积累的组件化经验，为团队提供了一些可复用性更高的设计思路。

这次经历让我深刻认识到，适时提供跨领域的支持，可以有效推动项目进展，也为团队带来了新的开发视角。最终，项目顺利按时完成，团队的技术能力也在过程中得到了提升。
