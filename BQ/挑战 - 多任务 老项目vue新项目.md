In my previous role, I often had to juggle multiple projects simultaneously, especially when we were redeveloping older Vue 2 projects into Next.js and React. As the lead for this redevelopment, I not only had to manage my technical tasks but also guide and mentor new colleagues to help them get up to speed with our tech stack. This required planning my schedule meticulously and maintaining close communication with the team to ensure everyone stayed aligned with project goals. 

At one point, we faced tight deadlines for several projects, each with unique challenges. I focused on prioritizing tasks based on urgency and potential blockers, and I delegated responsibilities effectively, allowing team members to work independently while I provided support where needed. Balancing these responsibilities taught me the importance of organization, adaptability, and the value of empowering my team to work efficiently under pressure.

在我之前的工作中，我经常需要同时处理多个项目，尤其是在我们将旧的 Vue 2 项目重构为 Next.js 和 React 时。作为这一重构项目的负责人，我不仅要完成自己的技术任务，还要指导和辅导新同事，帮助他们快速熟悉我们的技术栈。这需要我精心安排时间，并与团队保持密切沟通，以确保每个人都能紧跟项目目标。

有一次，我们面临多个项目的紧迫期限，每个项目都有其独特的挑战。我专注于根据紧急程度和潜在障碍优先安排任务，并有效地分配职责，让团队成员可以独立工作，而我在需要时提供支持。平衡这些责任的经历让我深刻体会到组织能力和适应性的必要性，同时也认识到赋予团队工作效率和在压力下保持稳定的重要性。
