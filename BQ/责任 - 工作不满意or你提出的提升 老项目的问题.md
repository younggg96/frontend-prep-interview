There was a time when our team faced significant challenges maintaining an older project. The feature requirements were from years ago, and there was no comprehensive documentation available—specific requirements had only been communicated verbally or relied on the memory of a few team members. Without a detailed requirements document, it was difficult to fully understand the core logic of the system, leading to delays and repeated rework whenever we tried to modify or fix issues. This situation left the team feeling quite frustrated.

If we had had thorough documentation from the beginning, or if there had been a knowledge transfer when people leave the team, we could have avoided these issues. To address the gap, I suggested that the team review the code and analyze current functionalities to reconstruct the requirements and create a new, up-to-date functional document. 

We also organized several meetings with team members who familiar with the project to share their thinking, that really help us to rebuild.

This experience let me know the importance of documentation in a project. After that, I made it a priority to updated all documentations in all projects to make sure that the team can quickly understand the requirements and help for the future maintenance.

有一次，我们的团队在维护一个很久以前开发的项目时遇到了困难。这个项目的功能需求已经很久远了，但没有任何完整的文档，所有的具体需求都依赖于口头传达或部分团队成员的记忆。由于没有系统的需求文档，我们很难准确理解系统的核心逻辑，导致修改功能和修复问题时频频遇到障碍，甚至造成了反复返工，团队因此感到非常挫败。

如果当时有全面的需求文档，或者在项目移交时进行了充分的信息传递，这种情况本可以避免。为解决这个问题，我建议团队通过代码分析和现有功能逐步重新梳理需求，并创建一份新的功能文档。我们还安排了几次讨论会，邀请一些熟悉项目的同事分享他们的理解，帮助填补信息缺口。

这次经历让我认识到文档在项目生命周期中的重要性。自那之后，我在每个项目中都主动推动需求文档的建立和更新，以确保即使过了很长时间，团队也能迅速掌握项目需求，减少未来的维护难度。
