I once recommended that we switch to Tailwind CSS to speed up styling and keep our code more consistent, but the team decided to stick with regular CSS. I understood their choice, as some team members were more comfortable with the traditional approach.

However, as the project grew, the CSS files became harder to manage, and keeping styles consistent across components became a challenge. We had to spend extra time refactoring styles and managing class names to avoid conflicts. This experience showed the impact of not using a utility-first framework like Tailwind for large projects and emphasized the importance of scalability in choosing tools.

当时我建议团队切换到 Tailwind CSS，主要是因为它的实用性和维护方便，特别是在我们这样一个不断扩展的项目中。Tailwind 的实用类可以减少大量的自定义样式代码，并且让样式定义更加模块化，这样不仅写起来快，还能确保代码风格的一致性。然而，团队中有一些成员对传统的 CSS 比较熟悉，他们担心学习新工具会影响开发进度，所以最后我们还是选择了沿用传统的 CSS。

随着项目不断迭代，CSS 文件逐渐变得复杂，重复的类名和样式也越来越多。每当一个新功能加入时，我们不仅要花时间在新样式上，还要小心避免已有的样式冲突，有时为了找到一个特定的样式错误，甚至要在代码中查找许久。而如果当初我们用了 Tailwind，这种问题大部分可以通过实用类和配置避免。

最终，我们不得不进行几次大规模的样式重构，以减少重复代码和整理类名。这不仅耗时耗力，还影响了开发的进度。这次经历让我更加深刻地意识到，在大型项目中，选择一个适合的工具并考虑长远的可维护性非常重要。如果当初团队考虑并接受了 Tailwind，后期的维护成本和样式冲突的复杂度都会降低很多。

At the time, I suggested switching the team to Tailwind CSS because of its practicality and ease of maintenance, especially for a growing project. Tailwind’s utility classes reduce the need for custom styles and make it easier to keep the code modular and consistent. It also speeds up development by allowing us to apply styles directly in the component code. However, some team members were more comfortable with traditional CSS and felt that learning a new tool might slow down the current project, so we decided to stick with CSS.

As the project grew, the CSS files became increasingly complex, with repeated class names and styles across components. Every time we added a new feature, we had to spend extra time managing styles, ensuring that we didn’t create conflicts with existing CSS. Sometimes, just tracking down a styling issue meant digging through multiple files to locate and fix overlapping styles
