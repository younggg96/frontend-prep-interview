有一次，我帮助了一位刚毕业的新同事适应工作任务。由于他刚进入职场，对项目流程和代码规范还不太熟悉，我主动向他介绍了团队的工作流程，并详细讲解了我们使用的技术栈和项目架构。我还安排了代码审查的时间，给他一些实践建议，帮助他逐渐提升代码质量。

在他遇到问题时，我鼓励他提出问题，并为他提供了解决思路而非直接答案，以帮助他逐步培养独立解决问题的能力。通过这段时间的引导和支持，他快速适应了工作节奏，提升了技术水平，并更好地融入了团队。这次经历也让我意识到，耐心指导和有效沟通对于帮助新人融入团队是非常重要的。

Once, I helped a newly graduated colleague adapt to our work tasks. Since he was new to the industry and unfamiliar with project workflows and coding standards, I proactively introduced him to the team's processes, explained our tech stack, and outlined the project architecture. I also scheduled regular code review sessions, offering practical suggestions to help him gradually improve his code quality.

Whenever he faced challenges, I encouraged him to ask questions and provided problem-solving strategies instead of direct answers, fostering his ability to tackle issues independently. With this guidance, he quickly adjusted to the work pace, improved his technical skills, and integrated smoothly into the team. This experience showed me the value of patience and effective communication in supporting new team members.
