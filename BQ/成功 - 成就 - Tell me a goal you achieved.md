The journey from a developer to a Senior Software Development Engineer was both challenging and incredibly rewarding. At first, I focused primarily on my own tasks, but over time, I took on the responsibility of leading our team, rebuilding previous projects, and mentoring new colleagues. I remember a few times when we hit technical roadblocks—everyone would come together to brainstorm, and finally solving those issues as a team was an amazing feeling.

Through this experience, I not only enhanced my technical skills but also learned how to communicate more effectively, delegate tasks, and guide the team toward a common goal. This transition allowed me to contribute beyond my individual work, helping the team streamline our development processes and grow together.

我从开发人员晋升为高级软件开发工程师的过程，其实是一个挺有挑战但也特别有成就感的旅程。刚开始我只是专注于自己的任务，后来逐渐开始带领团队，一起重构以前的项目，并且指导新加入的同事。记得有几次遇到技术难题，大家一起讨论、碰撞想法，最后成功解决的时候，那种成就感特别棒。

这个过程中，我不仅提升了自己的技术，还学会了如何更有效地沟通、分配任务，带领团队朝着共同的目标前进。这种转变让我不仅是单纯地完成自己的工作，而是能够站在更高的层面，帮助团队优化开发流程，一起进步。
