Once, two team members disagreed on how to build a feature. One wanted to use a ready-made library to save time, while the other thought we should build something from scratch to give us more flexibility. The back-and-forth was starting to affect the team’s mood, so I decided to help.

I talked to each of them alone first, letting them share their ideas fully so I could understand both sides. Then, we had a group meeting where I explained the good and bad points of each approach. We found a compromise: we’d use the library now to stay on track but keep in mind that we might switch to a custom solution if we needed to later.

This approach worked for everyone and showed us how important clear communication is. It also helped us handle future disagreements with more respect and teamwork.

有一次，我们团队中有两位成员在项目功能的实现方式上产生了分歧。一位认为应该优先使用现成的库来加快进度，而另一位则主张自己编写一个定制化的解决方案，以便获得更高的灵活性。这个争论逐渐影响了团队的士气，于是我决定介入调解。

首先，我分别与他们进行了一对一的沟通，倾听他们的想法，让每个人在不被打断的情况下充分表达自己的意见。这让我更清楚地理解了他们的顾虑，也让他们感受到自己的观点受到了重视。接着，我组织了一次团队讨论，客观分析了两种方案的优缺点，并提出了一个折中的方案：我们可以先使用现有的库来节省时间，但同时计划在项目需求进一步发展时考虑构建一个定制化的解决方案。

这个方法既满足了项目的进度需求，也保留了后续调整的灵活性。这次经历让我们都明白了清晰沟通和灵活应对的重要性，也为团队未来的合作树立了一个积极的榜样。
