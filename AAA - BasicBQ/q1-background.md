# 1. 背景 Can you briefly walk me through your background?

My name is Guanggeng Yang and I’m now working at VW as a Senior frontend developer.

So our team is frontend dev team. We are responsible for our e-Commerce platform, which help patient to purchase product in doctor's shop

I have been here for 4 yrs. I led the design and development of our entire frontend.

I implemented E-commerce core features such as product page, shopping cart, checkout flow, payment, order tracking system and more.

I also experienced with UI framework migration. I helped project migrate from Vue 2 to NextJS and ReactJS to improve performance and SEO.

Previously I worked at AA real estate edaction group as a frontend developer too. I built a mobile app by React Native, it help users to learn and pursue their real estate license.

I designed & implemented all features by myself, such as learning module, push notification, subscription.

As you can see, I am experienced with Javascript, react, nextJS, react native, vue and other UI realated technologies. if you are interested in any specific part of my experiences, we can start from there.

# 2. Why are you looking for new opportunities? why are you looking for new job?

As I just said, I have been at Vibrant Wellness for 4+ years. I led the design and development of our entire web application. At this point in my career at VW, my job duties have become less challenging and more repetitive.
I often found myself doing the same thing every day and didn’t have time to learn new technologies.
So it’s time for me to look outside opportunities to further my skills and career.

I like that kind of environment because I like working with people who care about what they do and push each other to do great work.
So I think it would be an amazing place to keep growing, take on new challenges, and work in a storng team.


# 3. I noticed you were working at two companies at the same time—can you explain that?

Yes, I’m glad you asked. During that period, I was transitioning into a full-time role at Vibrant Wellness while continuing to support Alexander-Anderson as a part-time remote role.
At Vibrant, I was responsible for building the frontend of the e-commerce platform. Meanwhile, I continued maintaining and shipping updates for the mobile app I had previously built for Alexander-Anderson along with some remaining tasks and handoff process.
I treated both roles seriously, set clear boundaries for time and priorities, and make sure that all deliverables were met with quality.
Finally, both projects stayed on track, we kept progress on the e-commerce platform building and deliver the regular updates for the app. After completed the handoff proceess, i was able to fully focus on development at vw.


This experience really improve my ability to manage multiple responsibilities, communicate across different teams
