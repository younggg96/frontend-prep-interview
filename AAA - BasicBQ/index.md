## Init Call 问题类型与例题：

1. 背景 & 当前状态
Can you briefly walk me through your background?
What are you currently working on?

I'm the lead frontend developer at vw.  I have been here for 4 years. I am the founding developer for our entire front end web application. I led the design and development of our entire web app, such as E-Commerce Core Features  the product and product detail page, payment, checkout, user authenication page, user profile and more. I am also experienced with UI framework migration. I helped VW to migrade its UI framework from Vue 2 to react and next.js. As you can see, I am experienced with  Javascript, react, nextJS, vue and other UI realated technologies. if you are interested in any specific part of my experiences, we can start from there.

Why are you looking for new opportunities? why are you looking for new job?

As I just said, I have been at VW for more than 4 years. I led the design and development of our entire web appilication. At this point in my career at VW, my job duties have become less challenging and more repetitive. I often found myself doing the same thing every day and did not have time to learn new technologies. So it is time for me to look outside opportunities to further my skill sets and career. I heard from Scott, who is also working at OKX, that OKX is looking for a front end developer. He told me about the fast pacing environment at OKX. I think it would be a perfect opportunity for me to challenge myself and learn more cutting edge technologies


2. 对公司的兴趣
What attracted you to this role/company?

I’m really excited about this role because it fits my background in frontend architecture and performance work. I’ve been leading projects that focus on speed, scalability, and clean design, and your company seems like a place where I can keep growing while working on meaningful products. I also like that you value collaboration—working with a strong team is important to me.

What do you know about our company or product?

Yeah! I know that OKX is one of the top global crypto exchanges, and you're also doing a lot in the Web3 space—like DeFi, NFTs, and wallets.
I really admire how you're building a fast, scalable platform for millions of users. As someone who cares about performance and frontend architecture, I find that super exciting.


3. 技术能力（轻量评估）
What’s your strongest programming language or framework?
Do you focus more on frontend, backend, or fullstack?
Have you worked with [React/TypeScript/Next.js/etc.]?
Have you built products from scratch or worked on large systems?

Yes, I’ve done both. In my current role, I helped rebuild a large e-commerce platform in the medical field—starting from scratch, migrating it from Vue 2 to a modern stack with React and Next.js. I was involved in setting up the architecture, building reusable components, and integrating APIs. I've also worked on large legacy systems where I had to understand existing codebases and gradually refactor or extend them without breaking things.


Yes, I’ve built products from scratch and also worked on large-scale systems. At Alexander Anderson Real Estate, I built a mobile app from the ground up using React Native. The app was designed to help users get their real estate licenses—it included learning modules, progress tracking, and scheduling tools. I handled the full front-end development, including UI design, navigation, and API integration.

In my current role at Vibrant Wellness, I’ve been leading the rebuild of a complex e-commerce platform in the healthcare space, migrating it from Vue 2 to React and Next.js. So I’ve had experience working on both new mobile apps and large enterprise web systems.


4. 项目经验
Can you tell me about a project you worked on recently?
（可以介绍一个你最近做过的项目吗？）
Sure! One of the most impactful projects I worked on was at Vibrant Wellness. I led the frontend rearchitecture of their e-commerce platform from the ground up. The old system was built with Vue 2 and had issues like slow builds, poor SEO, and inconsistent UI.
I redesigned the architecture using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, and implemented SSR and SSG for better performance and SEO. We also introduced component-based development and reusable patterns, which helped improve team efficiency and code quality.
As the frontend tech lead, I handled everything from architecture planning to mentoring junior devs. Within three months of launch, organic traffic went up by 30%. I’m proud because I took ownership from zero to launch and made a measurable business impact.

Can you describe a project you're proud of?

one of my proudest project is the web application I designed and developed at VW. I am the tech lead on this project and led a team of 3 to design and developed the current UI web application and brought it to production. in this project, I designed and worked on most of the major features such as the xxx pages and xxx pagesx... I still can remeber the moment that the web app went live and how proud and happy I felt.

Have you ever worked on a 0 → 1 project?
Have you worked in fast-paced or startup environments?

5. 行为和团队协作
Can you describe your working style in a team?
I’m a collaborative and transparent team player. I like to align early on goals and scope, and I make sure to communicate clearly during standups and code reviews. I enjoy pair programming when needed, and I often help break down tasks so the team can move faster. I also value feedback—both giving and receiving—because it helps us improve together.


Do you prefer working independently or collaboratively?

honestly, I enjoy both. I’m very comfortable working independently—I have led projects where I handled the full front end on my own, like the mobile app I built using React Native at Alexander-Anderson. At Alexander Anderson, I was the only developer there. for whatever project I work on, I need to do everything and by myself. I deisgned, developed and maintained the mobile app. I also worked on the deployment of the mobile app. basically i was not just a front end developer but more a full stack. But i enjoy front end developing more. so at vw, I become the tech lead here. I work closely and collaboratively with 3 other devlopers. I also work in cross-functional teams. I work closely with backend engineers, designers, and product managers to make sure everything fits together well. So for me, the ideal setup is a mix of both—focused solo time and good team communication.

How do you handle deadlines or shifting priorities?

Have you ever mentored teammates or led initiatives?

Yes, I’ve mentored junior developers on my team—helping them get up to speed with our tech stack, reviewing their code, and sharing best practices. I also led the frontend migration of a large Vue 2 codebase to React and Next.js, where I set up the architecture, broke down tasks, and worked closely with others to guide the transition. I really enjoy helping teammates grow.

6. 职位匹配 & 未来规划
What are you looking for in your next role?

I’m looking for a role where I can take on more technical ownership and work on more complex products. I enjoy working with modern front-end technologies, and I’d love to be part of a team that values good engineering practices and collaboration. It’s also important to me that the work has real-world impact, which is why this role really fit me.

What does an ideal team or project look like for you?
Are you open to in-office / remote / hybrid work?
What are your compensation expectations?
When would you be available to start?

I’m open to discussing that based on the role’s responsibilities and the overall compensation package. From my research and experience level, I’d expect $200,000 base, but I’m flexible depending on equity, bonus.


### workflow

My workflow’s pretty balanced. I usually start by checking tasks and syncing with the team in stand-up. Then I spend a good chunk of my day coding—probably around 60–70% of the time—working on features, fixing bugs, or doing some refactoring. The rest goes into code reviews, helping teammates, and communicating with product or backend to clarify things. I try to keep my work structured, so I don’t jump between too many tasks at once.


### prioritize your work - impact & urgency
If I have a bunch of tasks, I usually look at what’s most urgent or what’s blocking others, and start there. If priorities aren’t super clear, I’ll check in with the PM to make sure I’m working on the right thing. I try not to juggle too many things at once—breaking down big features helps me stay focused and make progress without feeling overwhelmed
