What attracted you to this role/company?

I’m really excited about this role because it fits my background in frontend architecture, performance optimization, and building UI component systems. I’ve led projects focused on performance, scalability, and clean user experience, and this role at Netflix feels like a great opportunity to continue growing in those areas.

That why i am interested in this role

What do you know about our company or product?

In my next role, I’m looking for an opportunity where I can work on meaningful, technically challenging products. I’m especially excited about building advanced user interfaces that help people understand and interact.

That’s one of the reasons I’m really interested in Twelve Labs. I admire the mission of making video searchable and understandable at scale, and I’d love to contribute to building the frontend systems that bring this intelligence to users in a usable, performant, and elegant way.

I’ve led frontend rearchitecture projects before, built component systems from scratch, and mentored junior developers. So while I enjoy being a strong individual contributor, I’m also open — and actually excited — to grow into more of a leadership role, where I can help guide frontend direction and support teammates along the way.

Ultimately, I’m looking for a place where I can learn from a world-class team, solve hard problems, and make a real impact — both through code and collaboration.


From a frontend perspective, I really admire how you’ve built such a fast and scalable experience across devices, and how you invest in design systems and internal tools to support developer productivity.
