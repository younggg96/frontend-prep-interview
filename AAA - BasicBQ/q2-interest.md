### What attracted you to this role/company?

I’m really excited about this role because it aligns closely with my background in frontend, performance optimization, and building scalable UI component systems.

That why i am interested in this role

### What do you know about our company or product?
In my next role, I’m looking for an opportunity where I can work on meaningful, technically challenging products, and Adobe stands out because of its global impact in creativity and digital experiences.

I greatly admire Adobe’s mission of enabling creativity for all and how you’ve evolved beyond traditional desktop software into cloud-based, collaborative platforms like Creative Cloud, Adobe Express, and Adobe Experience Cloud. From a frontend perspective, I’m especially impressed by how Adobe builds fast, scalable experiences across devices, while also investing deeply in design systems, accessibility, and developer productivity tools.

I’ve led frontend rearchitecture projects before, built component systems from the ground up, and mentored junior developers. So while I enjoy being a strong individual contributor, I’m also excited about growing into more of a leadership role — helping shape frontend direction, supporting teammates, and contributing to a culture of technical excellence.

Ultimately, I want to be part of a world-class team solving hard problems and delivering elegant, performant interfaces that empower people to create and communicate in new ways. Adobe feels like the perfect place to make that impact.

## **Why Netflix? / 对公司的兴趣**

I’m really excited about this opportunity because it aligns closely with my background in frontend engineering, performance optimization, and building scalable UI systems. I’ve led projects where the goal was to create clean, performant, and user-friendly experiences at scale, and I see this role at Netflix as a perfect opportunity to bring that experience to a product that reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world.


I’ve always admired Netflix, not just as a product I use every day, but also for how it sets the standard in streaming and user experience. What excites me about this role is the chance to work on something that reaches millions of people and directly shapes how they discover and enjoy content.

I enjoy building clean, fast, and user-friendly web experiences, and I see a strong match between what I’ve done in frontend performance and system design with what the Web Discovery team is focused on. For me, it’s not just about the technology, but about creating something people love to use—and Netflix feels like the perfect place to do that.
