### What attracted you to this role/company?

I’m really excited about this role because it aligns closely with my background in frontend, performance optimization, and building scalable UI component systems. I’ve led projects that focus on creating clean, performant, and user-friendly experiences, and I see this role at Adobe as a perfect opportunity to continue growing in those areas.

### What do you know about our company or product?
In my next role, I’m looking for an opportunity where I can work on meaningful, technically challenging products, and Adobe stands out because of its global impact in creativity and digital experiences.

I greatly admire Adobe’s mission of enabling creativity for all and how you’ve evolved beyond traditional desktop software into cloud-based, collaborative platforms like Creative Cloud, Adobe Express, and Adobe Experience Cloud. From a frontend perspective, I’m especially impressed by how Adobe builds fast, scalable experiences across devices, while also investing deeply in design systems, accessibility, and developer productivity tools.

I’ve led frontend rearchitecture projects before, built component systems from the ground up, and mentored junior developers. So while I enjoy being a strong individual contributor, I’m also excited about growing into more of a leadership role — helping shape frontend direction, supporting teammates, and contributing to a culture of technical excellence.

Ultimately, I want to be part of a world-class team solving hard problems and delivering elegant, performant interfaces that empower people to create and communicate in new ways. Adobe feels like the perfect place to make that impact.


## why zoox

I’m interested in Zoox because it’s one of the only companies pursuing autonomous mobility in a fully integrated way — the vehicle, the autonomy stack, and the fleet operations ecosystem are all designed together. That creates a level of technical depth and real-world impact that’s hard to find anywhere else.

I’m particularly like this Operational Tools role because it sits at the core of how the robotaxi service works day-to-day. The idea of building web applications that operators, safety teams, and engineers rely on in real time is something I find extremely meaningful.

My background aligns well with this: I’ve spent the past few years building performance-critical frontends, migrating large systems, optimizing latency, and designing tools that help users understand live system behavior — all of which connect directly to fleet monitoring and operations.

Finally, I really value the collaborative nature mentioned in the job description. I enjoy working closely with product, design, backend, and operators to ship tools that are truly used in the field.

Overall, Zoox’s mission and this role match both the kind of technical challenges I enjoy and the type of real-world impact I want to have.
