### What attracted you to this role/company?

I’m really excited about this role because it aligns closely with my background in frontend, performance optimization, and building scalable UI component systems. I’ve led projects that focus on creating clean, performant, and user-friendly experiences, and I see this role at Adobe as a perfect opportunity to continue growing in those areas.

That why i am interested in this role

### What do you know about our company or product?
In my next role, I’m looking for an opportunity where I can work on meaningful, technically challenging products, and Adobe stands out because of its global impact in creativity and digital experiences.

I greatly admire Adobe’s mission of enabling creativity for all and how you’ve evolved beyond traditional desktop software into cloud-based, collaborative platforms like Creative Cloud, Adobe Express, and Adobe Experience Cloud. From a frontend perspective, I’m especially impressed by how Adobe builds fast, scalable experiences across devices, while also investing deeply in design systems, accessibility, and developer productivity tools.

I’ve led frontend rearchitecture projects before, built component systems from the ground up, and mentored junior developers. So while I enjoy being a strong individual contributor, I’m also excited about growing into more of a leadership role — helping shape frontend direction, supporting teammates, and contributing to a culture of technical excellence.

Ultimately, I want to be part of a world-class team solving hard problems and delivering elegant, performant interfaces that empower people to create and communicate in new ways. Adobe feels like the perfect place to make that impact.
