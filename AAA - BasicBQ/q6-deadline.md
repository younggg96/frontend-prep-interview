# How do you handle deadlines and pressure
I actually enjoy working in deadline-driven environments—as long as expectations are clear.
The first thing I do is break down the work into smaller pieces so I can prioritize what absolutely needs to get done first.

Then I also try to keep communication very transparent. That helps avoid last-minute surprises and builds trust.

One example was during the relaunch of our e-commerce platform at Vibrant Wellness. We had a hard deadline to launch before a product promotion campaign,basically two weeks to complete and integrate a new checkout flow.

I broke the task into smaller and started with core functionality, layouts. 

I also worked closely with the backend team to align early with Requirements, API changes, data

For phase one, we focused on the must-haves: core checkout flow like shopping cart, shipping info, payment integration, and order confirmation.

Things like address auto-fill, coupon code animations, saved product management were nice to have, but not blockers. So we scoped those for phase two after the campaign.

The idea was to make sure users could smoothly place orders end-to-end without bugs. Then we’d follow up with our development plan to start phase two developmet and make our app more user friendly.

We worked some late nights, but in the end, we delivered on time.

It was definitely high pressure, but it taught me how to prioritize different tasks, communicate constantly, and still ship quality under a real deadline.
