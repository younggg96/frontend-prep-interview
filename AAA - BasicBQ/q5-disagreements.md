## How do you handle disagreements with colleagues or managers?
当与同事或上级意见不一致时你如何处理？

Answer (EN):
I try to focus on the problem, not the person. If there’s a disagreement, I like to clarify assumptions first—many conflicts come from misalignment on goals or context. I usually suggest a quick sync to talk things through, and if needed, I’ll bring data or examples to support my point. At the same time, I’m open to being wrong and will adjust if there’s a better idea on the table.

中文参考：
我倾向于聚焦问题本身，而不是人。如果出现分歧，我会先澄清彼此的前提和背景，很多分歧其实来自对目标或信息的不对齐。我通常会建议快速开个会沟通清楚，如果需要我也会准备数据或案例来支持我的观点。当然我也愿意接受更好的方案，如果别人提出的想法更合理，我会调整自己的立场。

## Tell me about a time you made a hard decision with limited information.

In one project at Vibrant Wellness, two engineers on my team disagreed on whether to use a new animation library for a key feature. The library looked promising, but we had very little time before release and didn’t know if it would be stable in our Next.js setup.

As the lead, I had to make a quick call. I decided we’d go with the stable approach for the release to avoid risk, and I asked the engineer who suggested the library to build a proof-of-concept afterward.

We shipped on time with no issues, and later testing showed the library wasn’t compatible anyway. It was a tough decision with limited information, but it kept us on schedule while still encouraging innovation.
