# 5. 行为和团队协作

## How do you typically work within a team? （你平时在团队中是如何工作的？）
In my current role at Vibrant Wellness, I am the frontend tech lead in a cross-functional team, working closely with product managers, designers, and backend engineers.

I lead the development of our frontend architecture, focusing on a scalable Design System and performance improvements like SSR and hydration optimization, while also driving feature delivery and building reusable UI components.

I also take on leadership responsibilities—like setting technical direction, and mentoring teammates.

We work in agile sprints, and I actively participate in planning, estimation, and breaking down epics into deliverable stories.

I work closely with designers to ensure pixel-perfect, accessible UIs. Work with product managers to break down features, clarify edge cases, and ensure alignment between user needs and technical constraints. With backend engineers, I help define scalable, cacheable APIs.
We usually align early on data structures, for example, we discuss pagination, filtering, and edge caching needs—especially for SSR pages. I often provide feedback from the frontend side, like how API shape affects hydration performance or User experiences.

Outside of feature work, I also help improve team efficiency by building shared tools, writing docs, and running things like pairing sessions. It’s all about helping the team move faster.

## What does a typical workday look like for you?（你的一天通常是怎么安排的？）
Answer:
A typical day starts with checking Slack and reviewing open PRs or Sentry alerts. We usually have a quick standup or async updates.

Then I’ll focus on either feature implementation (like building reusable components or integrating APIs) or cross-cutting work like performance tuning or accessibility testing.

I also spend time reviewing teammates’ code, and pairing with our designer to iterate on tricky UI details. A few times a week I’ll jump into design system support or mentor junior engineers.

At the end of the day, I usually track metrics on GA to see how the changes we shipped are performing.

## How do you collaborate with designers and backend engineers?（你是如何与设计师和后端工程师协作的？）
Answer:
For designers, I partner early—reviewing Figma files, offering feedback on feasibility, and aligning on tokens and components. We use Figma Tokens + Tailwind CSS to maintain design–code consistency, and I demo implementation in Storybook for early feedback.

With backend engineers, I align on data contracts and API shape early on. I often write interface schemas or test mock endpoints before the backend is ready. I also give feedback on how APIs impact frontend performance, caching, or SSR rendering.

This close collaboration helps us move fast without back-and-forth delays.

## Can you describe your working style in a team?
I’m a collaborative and transparent team player. I like to align early on goals and scope, and I make sure to communicate clearly during standups and code reviews. I enjoy pair programming when needed, and I often help break down tasks so the team can move faster. I also value feedback—both giving and receiving—because it helps us improve together.


## Do you prefer working independently or collaboratively?**
honestly, I enjoy both. I’m very comfortable working independently—I have led projects where I handled the full front end on my own, like the mobile app I built using React Native at Alexander-Anderson. At Alexander Anderson, I was the only developer there. for whatever project I work on, I need to do everything and by myself. I deisgned, developed and maintained the mobile app. I also worked on the deployment of the mobile app. basically i was not just a front end developer but more a full stack. But i enjoy front end developing more. so at vw, I become the tech lead here. I work closely with 3 other devlopers. I also work in cross-functional teams. I work closely with backend engineers, designers, and product managers to make sure everything fits together well. So for me, the good setup is a mix of both—focused solo time and good team communication.


## Have you ever mentored junior engineers? How did you help them?
你有指导新人吗？具体怎么帮助的？

Yes, I have mentored junior engineer. I usually start by helping them understand the architecture and project context. Then I guide them through writing clean, modular code and thinking through edge cases. I also do regular 1-on-1s to check in on progress and challenges. Over time, I try to help them grow not just technically, but also in terms of confidence and ownership.


## Tell me about a time when you balanced multiple responsibilities effectively.
多任务

I was transitioning into a full-time role at Vibrant Wellness while still supporting Alexander-Anderson as a part-time remote developer.

At Vibrant wellness, I was responsible for building the frontend e-commerce platform. Meanwhile, I needed to continue maintaining and updating the React Native mobile app I had previously built for Alexander-Anderson along with wrapping up a few remaining tasks and handling the handoff process.

To manage both roles effectively, I set clear time boundaries and maintained open communication with both teams. I prioritized weekly goals based on impact and urgency, and committed to deliver high-quality work while ensuring all deliverables were met on time and with quality.

Both projects stayed on track. We kept making solid progress on the Vibrant Wellness platform, and the Alexander-Anderson app continued to receive regular updates. After finishing the remaining tasks and handoff work at Alexander-Anderson, I was able to fully focus on the development at Vibrant Wellness. 

This experience really strengthened my ability to manage multiple responsibilities, communication between different teams，working independently.

## Can you give an example of working with a difficult teammate?

Yes, definitely. While working on the frontend rearchitecture project at Vibrant Wellness, I collaborated with a teammate who had a very different communication style—he preferred to work independently and wasn’t very responsive during standups or code reviews.
At first, it was hard to align on timelines and priorities, and it caused some blockers. So I scheduled a 1-on-1 chat to better understand his working style and explain how certain delays were affecting the team.
It turned out he wasn’t aware that his lack of updates was slowing others down. After that, we agreed to set clearer expectations on communication and made async updates more structured.
The situation improved a lot, and it taught me how important it is to address misalignment early and find a middle ground that works for everyone.

## Tell me about a time you made a mistake
Sure. Early in my time at Vibrant Wellness, I built a reusable component for our product detail pages. It worked fine in isolation, but I didn’t fully test how it would behave across all parts of the platform—especially on some of the older partner websites that used customized layouts.
After we pushed to production, certain pages on those partner sites is not working, and it caused display issues for a small group of users.
I took ownership right away, rolled the change back, and worked with QA to identify which layout has issues I had missed. After that, I introduced a better visual testing process and added it to our checklist.
It taught me that even small UI updates should be tested in the full real-world context, not just in isolated views.


I actually enjoy working in deadline-driven environments—as long as expectations are clear.
The first thing I do is break down the work into smaller, manageable pieces so I can prioritize what absolutely needs to get done first.
If the timeline is tight, I’ll raise trade-offs early—like what can be simplified or deferred—so the team can make informed decisions.
I also try to keep communication very transparent, both with PMs and engineers. That helps avoid last-minute surprises and builds trust.
At Vibrant Wellness, we often had to ship features on a tight weekly sprint schedule, and staying organized and proactive really helped keep things on track—even under pressure.
